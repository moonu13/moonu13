moonu13 here. i make websites.  

i do php. i do html. i do css. that's it.  

i make websites work. i make websites look good. sometimes i break them. then i fix them.  

i run littercat.shop. it's my site. i built it. i keep it running.  

i don't do fancy stuff. just php, html, and css. nothing else.  

if u see a website i made, it's clean. it's simple. it works.  

that's all.
